# Wordle
Just a python version of the famous game Wordle.
Wordle is a word guessing game in which the player has to guess a five-letter word, with some feedbacks given for each letter.
In this wordle, you can choose to not only guess a 5-letter word, but also a 3,4 or a 6-letter word.
Not that good in coding, so if you find any bugs or you feel like adding something, feel free to go ahead.
